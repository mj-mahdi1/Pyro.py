"""
We need to refactor the code to be modular, efficient, and easy to extend:
Goals :
1.Modular Code Structure:
-Separate code into modules and functions.
-Organize the codebase so that each component has a clear responsibility.

2.Data Management:
-Store reaction data, species information, and initial conditions in external files (e.g., CSV, JSON, or Excel).
-Use data structures that can efficiently handle large datasets (e.g., pandas DataFrames).

3.Efficient ODE System Setup:
-Use matrix operations to represent the system of ODEs.
-Leverage sparse matrices if the system is large and sparse.

4.Scalable ODE Solving:
-Choose ODE solvers optimized for large systems with sensitivity analysis feature.
-Consider solvers that handle stiff equations.

5.Maintainability and Extensibility:
-Make it easy to add new reactions and species without modifying the core code.
-Ensure the code is readable and well-documented.

Proposed structure:
/lignin_pyrolysis/:(Root project folder)

├── data/ (contains external data files like reactions.csv and species.csv)
│   ├── reactions.csv
│   └── species.csv
├── modules/ (Contains all the Python modules .py files that make the codebase)
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── reactions.py
│   ├── species.py
│   ├── data_handler.py
│   ├── kinetics.py
│   ├── ode_solver.py
│   └── utils.py
├── main.py (The main script that runs the simulation)
└── README.md
